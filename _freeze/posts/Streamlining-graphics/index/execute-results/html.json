Graphics for pairs of variables---scatter plots---are covered later. There's not much emphasis at all on graphics for multiple variables.\n\nIn contrast, *Lessons* introduces only a single, basic graphical modality---the point plot---to handle both categorical and quantitative variables and for displaying single variables, pairs of variables, and multiple variables. Why leave out the other modes?\n\n*Lessons* tries to make clear an important distinction; there is (raw) data and there are summaries of data. We don't want students to confuse a summary with the (raw) data itself. Graphically, data are shown as dots that have a direct relationship to the data frame being graphed: one dot for each row of the data frame (\"specimen,\" as we call it). Summaries of data are shown in a different graphical modalities, all of which are readily identified as shading regions rather than dots.\n\n\n::: {#fig-distinction .cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ mother + sex)\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ mother + sex, annot=\"model\")\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ sex, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Raw data](index_files/figure-html/fig-distinction-1.png){#fig-distinction-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Summary: model](index_files/figure-html/fig-distinction-2.png){#fig-distinction-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Summary: distribution](index_files/figure-html/fig-distinction-3.png){#fig-distinction-3 width=672}\n:::\n\nRaw data are shown with a different graphical modality than summaries of data.\n:::\n\n\n```\n\n\n\nIndeed, we avoid single-variable graphical modes mentioned in the previous paragraph. \n\n\n",
