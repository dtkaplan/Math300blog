(This is roughly consistent with the Internet factoid that the probability of a car accident in 1000 miles is 1/366.)\n\nWhat might a skeptical regulator reasonably believe about newly released self-driving cars? \n\n\"These things are crazy. Very likely to get in an accident.\"\n\n\"Perhaps a 1% chance that they are safer than regular cars.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt takes some math to translate these views into a prediction about the actual mean time between accidents. We teach that in other courses. But here is a graph of such a probability function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nbelief <- function(M)  ifelse(M > 1e6 | M < 10, 0, 0.9943/M^1.4)\n\nslice_plot(belief(M=M) ~ M, bounds(M=10000:500000), npts=500) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept=~ 200000, color=\"blue\", alpha=0.5) %>%\n  gf_labs(y=\"Belief\", x=\"Miles per accident\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is called a \"prior\" probability distribution: our starting point.\n\nNow data comes in. Each day we get a report from all the self-driving cars:\n\n- How many miles have they driven successfully, or\n- What was their mileage at the crash.\n\nBased on these data, we update our beliefs to produce a \"posterior\" probability distribution. The Bayesian updating rule is:\n\nPosterior(m) $\\propto$ Likelihood(m, observations) $\\times$ prior(m)\n\nSuppose the observation is: car crashed at 23,241 miles. A plausible **likelihood function* is based on simple probability, not the prior. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ncrash_likelihood <- function(m, mileage) {\n  dexp(mileage, rate=1/m) \n}\nslice_plot(crash_likelihood(m, mileage=30000) ~ m, bounds(m=5000:500000)) +\n  labs(title=\"Likelihood function for m given crash at 30,000 miles\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is also a likelihood function for a car having driven 30,000 miles *without* an accident.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nnocrash_likelihood <- function(m, mileage) {\n  (1- pexp(mileage, rate=1/m)) \n}\nslice_plot(nocrash_likelihood(m, mileage=30000) ~ m, bounds(m=5000:500000)) +\n  labs(title=\"Likelihood function for m given no crash up to 30,000 miles\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Now for the data\n\nThe New York Times report indicates 400 crashes out of 360,000 self-driving cars.\nSuppose we observe these data for Tesla\n\n95 cars have driven 20K miles without an accident; \n5 cars had accidents respectively at 1K, 4K, 8K, 12K, 16K \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlog_likelihood_observed <- function(m) {\n  ( log10(nocrash_likelihood(m, 20000))*95) +\n    log10(crash_likelihood(m, 1000)) +\n    log10(crash_likelihood(m, 4000)) +\n    log10(crash_likelihood(m, 8000)) +\n    log10(crash_likelihood(m, 12000)) +\n    log10(crash_likelihood(m, 16000)) \n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlog_posterior <- function(m) log_likelihood_observed(m) + log10(belief(m))\nslice_plot(10^((log_posterior(m)+38)) ~ m, bounds(m=2000:500000), npts=1001) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=200000, color=\"red\") +\n  ylab(\"Posterior: relative probability\") + xlab(\"Average miles per accident\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe posterior indicates that data on 100 cars, 5 of which had accidents before 20,000 miles, places most belief that the self-driving cars are safer than regular cars: about twice as safe.\n\nThis is counter-intuitive, since we have **no data** on cars that drove farther than 20,000 miles. But would be hard to get 95 out of 100 cars to 20,000 without an accident if the mean distance betwee accidents were even 100,000 miles.\n",
