For more than 15 years, statistical educators in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota have been gathering a half-dozen times a year at StatChat to share comradeship and teaching insights. Among the schools regularly represented are the University of Minnesota, Macalester College, St. Olaf College, Hamline University, Augsburg University, Carleton College, St. Cloud State University, and Minnesota State University Mankato.*\n\n**Abstract**: \"Mere Renovation is Too Little Too Late: We Need to Rethink Our Undergraduate Curriculum from the Ground Up\" is the title [2015 paper](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/mererenovation/) by George Cobb. Honoring George's challenge, I have been rethinking and re-designing the introductory statistics course, replacing traditional foundations using modern materials and reconfiguring the living and working spaces to suit today's applied statistical needs and projects. In the spirit of a \"model house\" used to demonstrate housing innovations, I'll take you on a tour of my \"model course,\" whose materials are available free, open, and online. Among the features you'll see: an accessible handling of causal reasoning, a unification of the course structure around modeling, a streamlined yet professional-quality computational platform, and an honest presentation of Null Hypothesis Testing that connects it to more current forms of statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe \"consensus\" Stat 101 is 50 years out of date:\n\n- fails to engage issues of causation, covariation, and adjustment\n- too much emphasis on p-values \n- entirely ignores Bayes\n- no substantial coverage of risk, risk factors, ... \n- uses a confusing over-variety of graphic modes (which are out-of-date)\n- doesn't make contact with data science, machine learning, and AI/GPT\n\nMy objective: Demonstrate the extent to which it's possible to overcome these deficiencies with a complete, practicable, no-prerequisite course.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the above points anytime, but that's not the point of this talk.\n\n## Style\n\na. Demonstrate and describe statistical phenomena by causal simulation\n    - Examples:\n        - sampling variation\n        - confounders, covariates, colliders, adjustment\n    - Stat theory from simulation/wrangling rather than probability/algebra\n#. Informal inference from the very beginning, *gradually* formalizing it over the semester\n#. Single, standard format for graphics\n#. Remove square roots whenever that's easy\n    - focus on variance rather than standard deviation\n    - R^2 rather than r\n#. Very small computational footprint, a dozen stat/graphics/wrangling functions.\n\n## Course overview\n\n- Part 1: Handling data\n    - Data frames\n    - Graphics (data and models)\n    - Wrangling\n\n- Part 2: Describing relationships\n    - Regression (incl. categorical and multiple explanatory variables)\n    - Adjustment\n\n- Part 3: Randomness and the unexplained\n    - Simulation and DAGs\n    - Probability models (optional)\n    - Likelihood (prep. for Part 5)\n    - Measuring and accumulating risk\n\n- Part 4: Understanding modeling\n    - Sampling variation and confidence intervals/bands \n    - Causality/Confounding/Adjustment\n    - Experiment\n\n- Part 5: Hypothetical thinking\n    - Basic Bayes: competing two hypotheses\n    - Null hypothesis testing (What you get when there is no prior and no second hypothesis.)\n\n## Lesson 1. Data frames\n\nData is *always* in data frames.\n\n- Columns: Variables\n\n- Rows: \"Specimens\" / Unit of observation\n\nComputing concepts:\n\n- name of data frame\n- pipe\n- function()\n\nUsually start with a named data frame, piping it to a function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNats |> names()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"country\" \"year\"    \"GDP\"     \"pop\"    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson 2. Graphics\n\nBoth the horizontal and vertical axes are mapped to variables.\n\nJust one command: `pointplot()` produces point plot with automatic jittering as needed.\n\nTilde expression specifies which variable is mapped to y and x (and, optionally, color and faceting).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ mother + sex + sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson 3. Empirical distributions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ sex, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in pointplot(Galton, height ~ sex, annot = \"violin\"): x-axis variable is numerical, so only one violin drawn for all rows.\n              Perhaps you want to use ntiles() or factor() on that variable?\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson 4. Models as graphical annotation\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGalton |> sample_n(size=100) |> \n  pointplot(height ~ sex, annot = \"model\", alpha = 0.1, model_alpha=0.75)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGalton |> pointplot(height ~ mother + sex + sex, annot = \"model\", alpha = 0.1, model_alpha=0.75)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson 5: Wrangling\n\n[Perhaps use two class days]\n\nFive basic operations: `mutate()`, `filter()`, `summarize()`, `select()`, `arrange()`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  country  year   GDP   pop\n  <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Korea    2020   874    32\n2 Cuba     2020    80     7\n3 France   2020  1203    55\n4 India    2020  1100  1300\n5 Korea    1950   100    32\n6 Cuba     1950    60     8\n7 France   1950   250    40\n8 India    1950   300   700\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNats |> filter(year == 2020)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  country  year   GDP   pop\n  <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Korea    2020   874    32\n2 Cuba     2020    80     7\n3 France   2020  1203    55\n4 India    2020  1100  1300\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNats |> summarize(totalpop = sum(pop), .by=year)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n   year totalpop\n  <dbl>    <dbl>\n1  2020     1394\n2  1950      780\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson 6: Computing recap\n\n[Perhaps merged into a two-day wrangling unit with Lesson 5]\n\nPipes, functions, parentheses, arguments, ...\n\n## Lesson 7: Databases\n\n[Entirely optional]\n\n- Joins \n- Why we put related data into tables with different units of observation.\n\n\n\n## Objects and operations\n\na. Data frame\n#. Data graphics (as distinct from \"infographics\")\n#. Statistical model\n#. Simulation\n\nOperations for all students\n\n1. Data wrangling (simplified)\n2. Annotated point plot of variables from a data frame\n3. Model training\n4. Model summarization\n\nOperations used in demonstrations (and suited to some students)\n\n5. Simulation (in demonstrations)\n6. Iteration and accumulation (in demonstrations)\n\nComputations on variables are always **inside** the arguments of a function taking a data frame as an input.\n\nTilde expressions for models and graphics.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Jeff Witmer (2023) \"What Should We Do Differently in STAT 101?\" *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education* [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26939169.2023.2205905)\n\n",
