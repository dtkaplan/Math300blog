```

## Statistical

1. Measure variation using the "variance." In R, 

```{r results="hide"}
Galton %>% summarize(vh = var(height))
```

2. Response variable will always be quantitative/numerical in a regression model.

3. Expect graphics in our section to always have the response variable on the vertical axis.

## Administrative

4. DO THE DAILY WORKSHEET! You'll fall behind if you don't.

5. Bookmark [this class site](https://dtkaplan.github.io/Math-300Z/) in your browser. That way you don't have to detour through Teams.

6. Use the Z-section project on `posit.cloud`. Bring in the worksheet using

```{r eval=FALSE}
math300::get_lesson_worksheet( LESSON NUMBER )
```
