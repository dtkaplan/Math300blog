    "text": "The results are pretty good, to judge from a couple of initial trials. But, clearly, you cannot be completely oblivious about how R works to make sense of the results.\nChatGPT: This R code runs a linear regression model on the mtcars dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R containing information about 32 different cars. The model aims to predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of a car based on its horsepower (hp) and number of cylinders (cyl).\nHere’s a breakdown of what each part of the code means:\nTogether, the code lm(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data=mtcars) fits a linear regression model with mpg as the response variable and hp and cyl as the predictors, using the mtcars dataset. The output of the lm() function will include information about the coefficients of the model, as well as measures of model fit and statistical significance.\nChatGPT: This R code does not work because there is a syntax error in the formula provided to the lm() function. Specifically, there is an extra comma (,) after the cy variable, which causes R to interpret the formula incorrectly.*\nThe correct syntax for the lm() function requires that the formula is separated from the data argument using the data= parameter. Here’s the corrected code:\nThis code specifies the formula mpg ~ hp + cyl as before, and the data= parameter specifies that the data for the analysis should be taken from the mtcars dataset."

    "text": "Comments\n\nChatGPT has a preferred set of words for describing computation. All the ones I see here are legitimate, but they don’t reflect the usage in the Math 300 textbook. Examples:\n\n“parameter”—We tend to use “argument” or “input,” as in “The data= input to lm().”\n“formula”—We use the phrase “tilde expression.” That’s because our course is mathematical in nature. In mathematics, “formula” refers to an arithmetical combination of quantities, as in \\(mx + b\\). If you want to construct a linear regression model along the lines of \\(mx + b\\), your tilde expression will look like y ~ 1 + x, assuming that y is the name of your response variable and x is the name of the explanatory variable.\n\nIn the 2nd example, ChatGPT didn’t mention that cy is not a variable in the mtcars data frame. It did, however, correct it to cyl in the example code."

    "text": "Some questions and answers are statistical in nature, and others not. How can you know which is which?\nI’m thinking of starting my statistics class today by asking my students their ages. Next, a mathematical question: Is everyone in the class of the same age? That’s an easy question to answer, of course. The question is mathematical in the sense that it involves mathematical stuff—numbers—and there is a single, correct answer.\nI expect that not everyone will be the same age. That is, age varies among the members of the class. Now the question is: Why does age vary? When a statistical answer will be in the form, “Age varies because this other quantity or characteristic varies among the group.” This style of answer attempts to account for the variation in age by the variation in other things. For instance, the students don’t all have the same major, and different majors may place the stat course at different points in the students’ studies. Or, students entered the academy at different points in time. Presumably there would be less variation in age if we adjusted for each student’s age at matriculation.\nAnother question. Why are the statistics students typically about 20 years old? The answer that occurs to me is that almost all of the students are from the US and in the US students enter first grade around age 6 and continue through 12 years of primary and secondary education. Then they go to college and take stats in their second or third years. Few students have a gap between high-school graduation and college matriculation.\nThis answer is not statistical in nature. A statistical answers explains variation in one characteristic by appealing to the simultaneous variation in other characteristics. May statisticians may quarrel with my using words like “why” and “because.” But that is not central to the matter. What’s central to a question and answer being statistical in nature is that the question is about variation in a characteristic and the answer pairs that variation with variation in other characteristics.\n\nExample:\n\nNot a statistical question or answer: “Why is the sky blue?” Because blue light from the sun is scattered by small particles in the atmosphere.\nA statistical question and answer: “Why does the color of the sky change from time to time?” Because the weather is sometimes cloudy or foggy, and because the sun is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes rising or setting, and sometimes not visible at all."

    "text": "Figure 1: A drawing of dag06, to use as an example.\n\n\n\n\nDAGs (“directed acyclic graphs”) have three properties, all of which are essential for representing causality.\n\nThey are “graphs” in the technical vocabulary of mathematics. That is, they consist of nodes and edges. Each edge connects two (and only two) of the nodes. In Figure 1 there are four nodes, labeled a, b, c, and d. Coincidentally, there are also four edges, one of which is c\\(\\longrightarrow\\)d.\nEvery edge is directed, that is, it points from a source node to a target node. Think of the directed edge as if it were a pipe carrying causal “fluid” from the source to the target. All the pipes in a graph are one-way only. In Figure 1 each of the edges is an arrow. The edge a\\(\\longrightarrow\\)b means that causal “fluid” can flow from a to b, but not from b to a.\nThere are no loops in the fluid flow (that is, there are no “cycles” of flow). In the name DAG, this is the meaning of the A: “acyclic,” meaning “no cycles.”\n\n\nExercise: Figure 1 is a DAG. By reversing the direction of a particular edge, you can modify the graph so that it has a cycle of flow. Which edge will do the job.\nExercise: Figure 1 does not have an edge connecting c and a. Add in that edge, directing it so that the new graph is still acyclic.\n\nStarting in Lesson 30, we will get into the ways to use DAGs in order to select explanatory variables that produce a model that is a faithful representation of the causal flows.\nFor the next few lessons, we will use DAGs for another purpose: to simulate data and make it easy to conduct random trials.\nOther than for teaching purposes (as in (3)), the role of DAGs in statistics and data analysis is to encode hypotheses about how elements of a system might be connected. Usually, you work with DAGs that reflect your and your colleague’s beliefs about how things are connected in the real world. Of course, believing a hypothesis does not make it true. Think of a DAG as a piece of fiction. Sometimes fiction is close to real life, and sometimes not. Both situations have their purposes for story-telling."

    "text": "Lesson 21\n\nIt is helpful to think of any response variable as a combination of “signal” and “noise.” The signal reflects how the explanatory variables are related to the response. The noise is the unexplained part of the response variable. More precisely, the “noise” is that part that we do not care to explain in terms of relationships to other variables.\nThe idea that there is always noise in the response variable allows us to train models that do not go through every (or even any) data point. This enables us to claim that simple shapes of models can be good representations of relationships among variables.\nIn Math 300Z, with few exceptions we will work with models that have one or two explanatory variables. A nicer feature of such models is that we can draw a graphic of the model using just two or three aesthetics.\n\naes(y= ), the vertical axis: always will be assigned to the response variable. (This is a Math 300Z convention, and a good one, but not universal.)\naes(x= ), the horizontal axis: the first explanatory variable will be assigned to this.\naes(color= ) if there is a second explanatory variable, it will be assigned to color.\n\nThe model_plot() function will take care of all this assignment of variables to aesthetics.\nSince explanatory variables can be either categorical or quantitative, there are only a handful of model shapes we need to deal with. (The response variable is always quantitative.) These are enumerated in the Instructor’s notes for Lesson 21.\nAn excellent type of exam question would show you the graph of a model and ask you to identify whether there is one or two explanatory variables, and what type(s) it (they) are: quantitative or categorical.\nThere is also a role in statistics for models that have zero explanatory variables. The tilde expression for such models (letting y be the response variable) is y ~ 1. We have not yet discussed what the use is of such models.\nThe data used to build a regression model is called the training data. It is a data frame containing both the response variable and any explanatory variables. Once a model is built, we often run the rows of the training data through the model function. Doing this divides the response variable values into two components:\n\nThe signal, which is the model function output for each row of the training data. We call this the “model value.”\nThe noise, which for each row of the training data is the difference between the value of the response variable (the “response value”) and the “model value.” This difference—one for each row of the training data—is called the “residual”.\n\nRemember this simple relationship:\n\nresponse value = model value + residual\n\nOften we will need to measure how big these three things are. We use the variance as the measure of “how big.” The variance is only one of many possible ways to quantify “how big.” But it has the great advantage that\n\nvar(response value) = var(model value) + var(residual)"

Instead, it means that high blood pressure contributes to an increased risk of mortality.\nA DAG (Directed acyclic graph—unnecessarily intimidating name!) is a way of encoding a hypothesis of what causes what in a system. We discussed the system involving treating a battlefield casualty with a tourniquet. (Link to in-class activity.) The system—a “system” is a collection of components—involved USE of a tourniquet, SEVERITY of injury, staying alive long enough for ADMISSION to hospital, and post-hospital SURVIVAL. Common sense suggests some causal connections:\n\nSEVERITY \\(\\longrightarrow\\) USE, since tourniquets are used for severe injuries involving bleeding from a limb.\nSEVERITY \\(\\longrightarrow\\) ADMISSION. The more severe the injury, the less likely the soldier is to reach the hospital.\nADMISSION \\(\\longrightarrow\\) SURVIVAL. There would be little point to having hospitals if they didn’t contribute to survival!\nSEVERITY \\(\\longrightarrow\\) SURVIVAL. Even if reaching the hospital, the soldier’s survival is in part determined by the SEVERITY of the injury.\n\nOther link were more hypothetical:\n\nUSE \\(\\longrightarrow\\) ADMISSION\n\n\nUSE \\(\\longrightarrow\\) SURVIVAL\n\nA DAG describes the hypothesized causal links among all the system components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore detail\n\n\n\nThe clinical study looking at the relationship between tourniquet use and survival included only those patients admitted to the hospital, not the ones who died before admission. Their data did not demonstration a relationship between USE and SURVIVAL. That is to say, the hypothesized DAG as a result of the study was this:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this second DAG, there is no causal connection between USE and SURVIVAL.\nA critique of the clinical trial is that it didn’t consider ADMISSION, that is, both those soldiers who reached the hospital and those who didn’t. Consequently, even if there were no direct link between USE and SURVIVAL, a more complete DAG includes a possible indirect path, as in this third DAG:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path USE \\(\\longrightarrow\\) ADMISSION \\(\\longrightarrow\\) SURVIVAL could not be demonstrated by the (imperfect) clinical study, even though it might well exist. Any decision about the efficacy of tourniquets would need to consider the possible path USE \\(\\longrightarrow\\) ADMISSION \\(\\longrightarrow\\) SURVIVAL.\nHere’s a paradox: Effective use of tourniquets increases hospital mortality rates. Explain why this says something positive about tourniquet use."
